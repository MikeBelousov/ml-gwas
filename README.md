# Genome-wide association studies based on machine learning

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aims to find genetic variants associated with a chosen phenotype. Since 2005 they are rootinely applied. Ususally up to a few millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are statistically tested to detect those ones significantly associated with the phenotype. In this repo we provide the scripts to develope the alternative methods of detection of associated SNPs. They are based on SNP ranking via machine learning.
